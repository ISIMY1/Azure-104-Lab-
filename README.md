# Lab 01 – Azure Cloud Overview

## Objective

Understand the different types of cloud models and Azure services, and apply this knowledge through guided labs.


### Skills Learned

- Differences between private, public, community, and hybrid clouds
- What cloud computing is and its key features
- Azure service types (compute, storage, networking, etc.)
- Enterprise Agreement (EA) structures, limits, and quotas
- Reliability and feature considerations for Azure

### Tools Used

- Azure Portal – The web interface to create, configure, and manage Azure resources. Used for creating VMs, Web Apps, resource groups, and exploring subscriptions, limits, and quotas.

- Azure Resource Explorer – Browse and inspect the JSON configuration of Azure resources. Useful for understanding the resource hierarchy (subscriptions → resource groups → resources).

- Azure Cost Management & Billing – Monitor usage, quotas, and costs. Useful for understanding EA structures, limits, and quotas.

- Azure Quickstart Templates  – Prebuilt templates for deploying resources quickly. Helpful for hands-on exercises like creating VMs or Web Apps.
  
## Summary
In this lab, I explored the fundamental concepts of cloud computing and Microsoft Azure services. I learned the differences between **private, public, community, and hybrid clouds**, and how each is applied in real-world scenarios. I gained hands-on experience creating **Virtual Machines (IaaS)** and **Web Apps (PaaS)** in the Azure Portal, setting up resource groups, and understanding subscription limits and quotas.  

Additionally, I reviewed **Azure service types**, Enterprise Agreement (EA) structures, reliability considerations, and key features that make Azure a robust cloud platform. This lab helped reinforce my understanding of **when and how to use different cloud services**, preparing me for practical tasks in cloud administration and the AZ-104 exam.
